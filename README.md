# react_projects
A repository documenting my journey of Mastering react

# 1) Expense Tracker
A small react expense tracking app.You can find the code in the master branch of the repo.

# 2) Muti Step Form
A small form whch alows you to enter your username and email (without validation) in one part and displays nin the second.
I built this moslty to get my heat aroung teh concept of context in react and a way to shave out redux  from projects.Code can be found in multi-form-branch
